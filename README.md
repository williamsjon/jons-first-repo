repo-template

This repo is a starting point for uniformity among project repos.  Just clone it and create an RStudio project from the now-existing folder and you're off.  You also need to create a `data` folder at the top level to go with others seen here, but note that it is already added to .gitignore, so its contents should never appear on GitHub.

Consult the `other_docs/style_suggestions.Rmd`  before getting too carried away.
